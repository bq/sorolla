{"name":"Sorolla","tagline":"Image scaling, tinting & coloring utilities optimized for Android resources","body":"**Sorolla** is a simple Python package that provides an easy way to scale, tint and color-fill any kind of image.\r\n\r\nIt is especially designed for Android resources, giving support to Android standard and Nine-patch resources while keeping their properties. It also supports vector resources, such as .pdf and .svg. \r\n\r\nThe library also detects if the resource contains the nine-patch resource notation (.9.<file_extension>) in its file name so it can work with it while keeping the nine-patch's properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requirements and installation\r\n\r\nIn order to use *Sorolla* you need the following programs installed in your system:\r\n\r\n- Python 2.7.x\r\n- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) and [GhostScript](http://www.ghostscript.com/) installed in the system and available from PATH. Install them from a package management tool or build them from source.\r\n\r\nThe package has been tested in *Ubuntu 14.04, Windows 8.1 & Mac OS X 10.10*\r\n\r\nIf you want to install the package in your current Python instance run:\r\n```bash\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\nor:\r\n```bash\r\n$ python setup.py develop\r\n```\r\nif you want to install the library for debugging or testing purposes.\r\n\r\nYou can also import the library from the *sorolla* folder and use it directly in your custom scripts.\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\nJust import the *Sorolla* class from the *sorolla* package in your Python script.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sorolla import Sorolla\r\n```\r\nThe *Sorolla* class exposes the following *static methods*:\r\n\r\n> **Sorolla.color_resource(source_file, dest_file, fill_color)**\r\n>\r\n>    Colors a raster resource; detects if it's a nine-patch via filename in order to color it properly\r\n>     \r\n>    Arguments:\r\n>\r\n>        source_file    Source file to color. Path can be relative or absolute\r\n>\r\n>        dest_file      Destination file where the colored file will be saved. Path can be relative or absolute\r\n>\r\n>        fill_color     Color to fill the resource. Must be a RRGGBB string.\r\n>     \r\n>    Returns:\r\n>        Whether the action could be run or not\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    **Sorolla.scale_resource(source_file, dest_file, scale)**\r\n>\r\n>    Scales a resource; detects if it's a nine-patch via filename in order to scale it properly\r\n>     \r\n>    Arguments:\r\n>\r\n>        source_file    Source file to convert. Path can be relative or absolute\r\n>\r\n>        dest_file      Destination file where the converted file will be saved. Path can be relative or absolute\r\n>\r\n>        scale          Scale value as a float. If it's greater than zero, the function upscales the image; if less than zero, it downscales the image\r\n>     \r\n>    Returns:\r\n>        Whether the action could be run or not\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    **Sorolla.tint_resource(source_file, dest_file, tint_color)**\r\n>\r\n>    Tints a gray-scaled raster resource; detects if it's a nine-patch via filename in order to tint it properly\r\n>     \r\n>    Arguments:\r\n>\r\n>        source_file    Source file to tint. Path can be relative or absolute\r\n>\r\n>        dest_file      Destination file where the tinted file will be saved. Path can be relative or absolute\r\n>\r\n>        fill_color     Color to tint the resource. Must be a RRGGBB string.\r\n>     \r\n>    Returns:\r\n>        Whether the action could be run or not\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\nYou can find an usage example in [example.py](https://github.com/bq/sorolla/blob/master/example.py) script.\r\n\r\nThe script acccepts the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ python example.py source_res_dir dest_res_dir rgb_hex_color_without_#\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis script takes a source folder containing:\r\n\r\n- A *drawable* folder which contains assets (preferrably .pdf or .svg) that need to be scaled & colored for all of Android's screen pixel densities, using *mdpi* scale as a base. (in our use-case, pure black resources)\r\n- A number of *drawable-<dpi>* folders which need to be tinted (in our use-case, gray-scale & pre-resized nine-patch resources)\r\n\r\nand saves the results in another folder ready to import them into an Android project.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: the script skips xxxhdpi resource generation, see [this excerpt from Android documentation](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#xxxhdpi-note) for more details.*\r\n\r\nSuppose that we have the following folders in \"source_res_dir\":\r\n\r\n![source_res_dir contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bq/sorolla/master/art/screen_1.png)\r\n\r\n![source_res_dir/drawable contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bq/sorolla/master/art/screen_2.png)\r\n\r\n![source_res_dir/drawable-xxhdpi contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bq/sorolla/master/art/screen_3.png)\r\n\r\nIf the following command is issued:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n$ python example.py source_res_dir dest_res_dir FF0000\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll get the following result:\r\n\r\n![dest_res_dir contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bq/sorolla/master/art/screen_4.png)\r\n\r\n![dest_res_dir/drawable-xxhdpi contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bq/sorolla/master/art/screen_5.png)\r\n\r\n(Contents in the rest of folders have been skipped)\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the Apache Software License, Version 2.0.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 bq\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
